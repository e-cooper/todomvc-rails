## TodoMVC Rails

This is a simple example Rails app created for our Bluemix workshop.  It uses a slightly modified version of the jQuery example from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) for the frontend and Rails for the backend API.

## Getting Started

1. Install gems:

        bundle

2. Start rails server:

        rails server

3. Using a browser, go to `http://localhost:3000`.
